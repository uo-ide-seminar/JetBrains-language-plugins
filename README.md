# JetBrains-language-plugins
Documentation and examples of our experience learning to build language-specific plugins for JetBrains IDEs

The simple language plugin subdirectory contains an implementation of a minimal plugin using the Gradle build system.
The plugin includes syntax hightlighting, custom file extension support, as well as custom icons associated with file
types. See https://github.com/uo-ide-seminar/JetBrains-language-plugins/blob/master/simple_language_plugin/README.md
