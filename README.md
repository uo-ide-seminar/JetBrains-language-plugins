## Intro
These projects are from a Winter 2019 Seminar Class at University of Oregon. Our intent was to try building plugins for JetBrains IDEs, including support for new languages. Our approach was to have individuals or small groups work on different small projects.

### Goals
Goals for the quarter are listed below:
1. Use IntelliJ IDEA to create plugins
2. Use Gradle for building plugins and learn more about how it works as a build tool
3. Work with Grammar-Kit and the PSI-Viewer, and learn about specific features
4. Create at least one working plugin supporting a new language
5. Determine what areas in the above processes are lacking documentation
6. Share our results including the problems that we ran into in order to help others in the future
